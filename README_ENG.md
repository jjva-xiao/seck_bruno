# bruno_fork
[中文](README.md)
Thanks for [Bruno](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/bruno) contribution，Because my project uses the Flutter 1.22.6 environment (the last version of Non-Air Safety)
Therefore, I adapted Bruno to the environment of Flutter 1.22.6, which can be used by students who need it. The plug-in is based on Bruno 2.0.0
